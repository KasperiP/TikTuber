## About The Project

I have seen too many kids uploading other people's TikToks to YouTube and getting 10k+ subscribers in in a few months so I decided to make this process as easy as possible and start grinding that YouTube bag ðŸ’°. TikTuber is designed to alert you on Discord when new TikTok gets uploaded by someone you have added to watchlist. You can watch the video, give it a title and simply upload it to YouTube from Discord via `/upload id title`-command. I would have made this fully automatic, but in order to get view to uploaded videos good title is required. ðŸ¤¥
